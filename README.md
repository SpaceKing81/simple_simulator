# Simple Simulator
A fun little project of making a digital brain
Basiclly I was working on the Advanced Simulator as a side quest, and then I realized that what I was doing was super complicated and annoying. So I went on an of-shoot of that project to do this simpler one, where physics would essentially be just neutonian in nature. Very simple, straightforward, and easy.

This one is going to be where I put a bunch of basiclly sample code, for when I need to simulate various effects for other projects, the logic can be built and/or collected here. The advanced simulation can hold more specilized and personal logic, and will be more true to physics itself, with some corrners cut for simplicity.

Goals:
- Make it actually work
- Able to click various key-binds to interact with the world and see stuff happen
- Add and remove objects at will
- Objects move and act like actual physical objects, going to stick with just cubes and spheres
